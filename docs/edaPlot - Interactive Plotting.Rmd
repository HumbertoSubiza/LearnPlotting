edaPlot (openintro package)

Use an interactive, exploratory plot function with a click-interface and eight graphing options. The type of plots generated are printed out in the console. To exit, click "exit" on the plot.
◾dataFrame – A data frame.

Example. Before using edaPlot, two outliers that truly don’t belong are removed from the marioKart data set, which is a data set concerning Ebay auctions of Mario Kart games on Ebay. (See Chapter 8 of OpenIntro Statistics.) By clicking on the options (axes left of variables or the plotting types), I generated seven interesting exploratory plots in under 2 minutes without any typing.

Download the Code
```{r} 
#install.packages("openintro")
library(openintro)

data(marioKart)
mk <- marioKart[marioKart$totalPr < 100,]
edaPlot(mk)

exit
